# objectOrientedDesignPatterns

# Strategy Design Pattern

 You use this pattern if you need to dynamically change an algorithm used by an object at run time. 
The pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses. 

#Observer Design Pattern

You use this pattern when you need other objects to receive an update when another object changes
